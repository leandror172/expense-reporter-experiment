## 2026-06-19 - Session 34: Review serialization fix (sheets→types) + classifier type emission + full-cycle acceptance; PR #32

### Context

Resumed mid-task after compaction: a latent `review.html` bug surfaced during the Option A full-cycle integration test — the first time the page was rendered AND opened since the Plan A/B `sheets`→`types` rename.

### What Was Done

- Created `internal/taxonomy/lookup.go` — shared reverse `(category,subcategory)→type` lookup (`BuildTypeIndex`/`LookupType`, sticky-ambiguity, NFC keys, sentinels) (commit 7b2f19b).
- Ran two parallel Sonnet subagents in isolated worktrees (5.R4 classifier-emits-type into `expenses_log.jsonl`; RUI-4 `type` column in batch-auto CSVs) and reconciled both branches onto `feat/type-routing-improvements` (commit 41afa56).
- Fixed the review serialization bug: Go `review` structs serialized `sheets`/`sheet` while the template JS had migrated to `types`/`type` — crashed the page (`TAX.types is not iterable`) and silently dropped RUI-4's type pre-fill. Renamed `Taxonomy.Sheets→Types`, `Predicted.Sheet→Type`, struct `Sheet→Type`; fixed the lone JS validator holdout; added a `render_test.go` JSON key-contract assertion (commit 321dd2f).
- Followed the rename into the acceptance consumer `test/review_test.go` (parsing `json:"sheets"`, hidden behind `//go:build acceptance`) — advisor caught this exact gap (commit 994d75b).
- Drove the full Option A cycle end-to-end via Claude in Chrome: served review.html over HTTP (fixing the `file://` localStorage error), assigned the ambiguous Dentista leaf → Variáveis, exported reviewed.json, ran `apply` (type backfilled into the log) → `generate-workbook` (Dentista routed to Variáveis by full path; type-stripped counterfactual dropped it entirely).
- Wrote `test/type_routing_cycle_test.go` + 7 synthetic fixtures — incremental full-cycle acceptance suite (batch-auto→review→apply→generate-workbook) (commit c5c064f). All 4 tests pass: T1 Ollama-gated ~38s; T2–T4 deterministic <0.05s.
- Synced stale memories + docs: `internal/review/.memories/QUICK.md` (it falsely claimed the rename was done + RUI-4 still open), `test/.memories/{QUICK,KNOWLEDGE}.md`, `.claude/index.md`.
- Opened **PR #32** (`feat/type-routing-improvements` → master) bundling all 5 branch commits; pushed with upstream tracking. Removed the two reconciled subagent worktrees.

### Decisions Made

- The review taxonomy/predicted structs are the domain representation surfaced to the UI → serialize as `type`/`types`. The translation seam is `BuildTaxonomy`: source-side helpers reading `resolver.SheetName` keep "sheet"; output structs become "type". This **reversed** the earlier RUI-4 boundary call (which kept `Predicted.Sheet`).
- Incremental acceptance design: one CLI step per test, prior steps fold into the Given, the last test is all-prep + only `generate-workbook`; the non-CLI steps (true/false→1/0 bridge, browser pick+export) fold into fixtures; apply's target workbook is built hermetically by `generate-workbook` (no committed binary `.xlsx`).
- New tasks confirmed with user: T-09 (retire bare-name fallback) + T-10 (5.R4 id collision). Declined a "Merge PR #32" task (it's the next action, not a tracked task).

### Next

- Merge PR #32 into master, then: year-rollover (T-03), retire bare-name fallback (T-09), fix the 5.R4 id collision (T-10), TF-IDF layer (5.R1).

### Gotchas

- A `json`-tag rename is NOT covered by `go build`/`go test ./...`: acceptance tests behind `//go:build acceptance` are skipped, and non-Go artifacts (fixtures, golden files, the embedded template) aren't compile-checked. After any tag rename, grep `test/`/`.claude/` for the old key and run `-tags=acceptance`. Saved as memory `feedback_rename_json_tag_acceptance`.
- `internal/review/.memories/QUICK.md` claimed the `sheet`→`type` rename and RUI-4 were already done when the Go code lagged — exactly the stale-memory footgun that let the `TAX.types` crash hide. Corrected with commit SHAs.
